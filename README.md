# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM_TASK 4

**COMPANY** : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME** : SURENDERAN R

**INTERN ID** : CT08DZZ

**DOMAIN** : MACHINE LEARNING

**BATCH DURATION** : DECEMBER 17th,2024 to JANUARY 17th,2025

## Project Overview
In this project, we:

- Load and preprocess user-item interaction data (e.g., movie ratings, product reviews).
- Build a Collaborative Filtering model using Matrix Factorization techniques.
- Evaluate the recommendation model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Precision@k.
- Visualize the recommendation results and show how the system can predict unseen user-item interactions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- numpy (for numerical computations)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for metrics)
- surprise (for collaborative filtering algorithms like SVD)
- matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Dataset
The project uses a sample MovieLens dataset (or any user-item rating dataset). The dataset consists of user-item interaction data, such as movie ratings or product reviews, which can be used to build the recommendation system.
You can download the MovieLens dataset from here.

## Code Structure
- recommendation_system.py: The main Python script containing the model definition, training, evaluation, and recommendation generation.
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- notebooks/: (Optional) If using Jupyter Notebooks, this directory may contain notebooks for exploring the data and model.
- data/: Folder for storing datasets (e.g., movie_ratings.csv or other relevant data files).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization techniques. The system is capable of predicting user preferences and recommending relevant items based on user-item interactions.
